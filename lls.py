    Assumptions: A key assumption we make is that contacts are bidirectional i.e. if there is a contact from A -> B
    then there is also a contact from B -> A. These contacts can also exist at the same time. Since we are dealing
    with lasers this might not be a valid assumption but since our data is unidirectional i.e. we are only
    transmitting data from Mars -> Earth, it doesn't matter anyway. This assumption should be revisited in the future
    as the scenarios become more complex. This data is embedded in the contact plan and not the code, so the code should
    already be written to support unidirectional contacts but logically, for now, all contacts are bidirectional.
